        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="paper-p">We present a hybrid centralized-decentralized
            planning algorithm for a multi-robot system consisting of
            a Mothership robot and multiple Passenger robots. In this
            system, the Passenger robots execute tasks while the Mothership
            provides support. This paper addresses the challenge of
            planning Passenger robot movements, framing it as a Stochastic
            Multi-Agent Orienteering Problem (SMOP) complicated by
            factors like stochastic operational efforts and disruptive events.
            We optimize the task completion efficiency of the system by
            combining centralized solutions from the Mothership with local
            plans from Passengers to enhance system resilience. Our contributions
            include defining the SMOP, developing a solution using
            Decentralized Monte Carlo Tree Search, presenting a hybrid
            algorithm that integrates centralized plans into the distributed
            framework, and evaluating the algorithm’s performance in
            a simulated environment. Our results show that our hybrid
            approaches outperform fully centralized and fully distributed
            algorithms in highly-dynamic scenarios with up to a 26.6%
            increase in task completion efficiency over baseline methods.</p>
